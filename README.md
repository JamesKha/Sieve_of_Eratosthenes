# Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
An implementation of an algorithm called the sieve of Eratosthenes, which would find all prime numbers up to a limit defined by a function. 
This project was implementated with the languages, GoLang and C++ and measured the time effiency of both programs. 

This was created for one of my Comparative Programming Languages course assignments.
